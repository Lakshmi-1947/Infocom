## Acknowledgement

We have slightly modified the original simulator to obtain Transport Block Sizes for various DM-RS, subchannel, and MCS combinations. We have included the code from their simulator for completeness. We are grateful to the authors — L. Lusvarghi, B. Coll-Perales, J. Gozalvez, and M. L. Merani — for making their simulator and dataset open-source, as they were indispensable to our work. If you use their simulator, please cite them as shown below:

## NRV2XSL-LinkLevelSimulator
This repo contains the source code of the MATLAB-based link-level simulator of NR-V2X Sidelink (SL) communications used to generate the link-level dataset available [here](https://uwicore.umh.es/NRV2XSL-LinkLevel.html).

The simulator has been developed at the [UWICORE](https://uwicore.umh.es/) laboratory of the Universidad Miguel Hernandez de Elche (Spain) and is protected under the GNU GPLv3 license. 

More info about the simulator structure and main functionalities is available in [this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10533255). If you use this code or the link-level dataset, please cite our work:
