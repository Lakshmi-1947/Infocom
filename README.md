We have slightly modified the original simulator and extended the dataset developed by L. Lusvarghi, B. Coll-Perales, J. Gozalvez, and M. L. Merani in addition to our contributions. We are greatful to them for making their simulator and dataset open-source, as they were indispensable to our work. If you use their simulator or dataset, please cite them:
